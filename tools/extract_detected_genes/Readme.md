# Extract Detected Genes

Some tools merely report on the names of the genes that were detected. The tools
in this folder will take that information and extract the sequences of the genes
that were detected.

### Input

  * Result file (format depending on the tool)
  * FASTA file with gene sequences

### Output

  * FASTA file with gene sequences of only the detected genes
